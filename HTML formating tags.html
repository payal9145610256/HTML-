            <h2>Factors Affecting Groundwater Quality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contaminants:</strong> Groundwater can become contaminated by various pollutants, including industrial chemicals, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.</li>
                <li><strong>Geological Conditions:</strong> The composition of geological formations through which groundwater flows can influence its quality by introducing minerals or altering pH levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Activities:</strong> Activities such as mining, fracking, and improper waste disposal can have adverse effects on groundwater quality by introducing pollutants into aquifers.</li>
            </ul>
